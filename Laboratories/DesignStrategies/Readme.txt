Problem 2.
Let T[0,...,n-1] be a sorted array of integers, some of which may be negative but all of which are
different. Give an algorithm that is able to find an index i such that 0≤i≤n-1 and T[i]=i, provided
such an index exists. Your algorithm should take a time in O(log n) in the worst case.
Hint: use divide-and-conquer strategy.


Problem 3.
You are to organize a tournament involving n competitors. Each competitor must play exactly once
against each of his opponents. Moreover each competitor must play exactly one match every day.
Assuming that n is a power of 2, give an algorithm to construct a timetable allowing the tournament
to be finished in n-1 days.
Hint: use divide-and-conquer strategy.
